        Development time was about 1 month assisted by Google, youtube, and a lot of asking ChatGPT "What does this mean?", "Why does it say this?", "What's difference between this and this and why are neither working?". 
        This has been an incredible learning experience and have enjoyed every single bit of it. Since this is my first project, I had to start out learning how to make the website. I learned HTML and CSS through many tutorials and
        simple expirimentation. I kept adding more and more, learning how to add links and create images etc. Then, I decided to start working the backend. Knowing absolutely nothing about APIs such as SpringBoot and databases like MySQL resulted in 
        questions and tutorials for who knows how long. Eventually I learned the mapping of an API and through step by step guides and a million more "What is this?" I built my controller, repository, and service. Then, I tweaked my final project from CS123 which had used recurrsion
        to instead act in a step by step action as it would work better for web based. I still preserved old code to look back at anytime I need. Eventually, it came time to set up the database. From my sources everyone said to use MySQL and although I had unbelievable amounts
        of trouble setting it up, eventually created a database and was able to create methods such as save and load that could take in a built tree and be accessed by anyone with the link. All of my testing was done using POSTMAN (which is awesome) and allowed me to
        also view the raw data. Once I had it all working, built the QuestionTree page with html and CSS and used AI to assist with JavaScript to make it all come together since I had very little experience with javascript for web based applications. Finally, I tied it all together
        using a configuration class (which I didn't know existed before) to allow for the user to access the backend code with the pretty front view. Overall, I learned a LOT through this and as a takeaway, feel I can confidently explain how APIs work and how they access databases.
        I also completely learned html and CSS and feel I've refreshed my brain on simpler ideas of javascript. If you wish to view any of my code feel free to reach out. I will also likely be creating a github account in the near future.
